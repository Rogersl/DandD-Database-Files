# DandD-Database-Files
Database files from our D&amp;&amp;D project.  Used SQLite3 in Python.

We used our server to manipulate the database, these python files contain the functions to create and manipulate the database file.

The rest of the files (server, webpage stuff) are over at https://github.com/somexotherxguy/DandandD
